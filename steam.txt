This is a custom tweak / fix for a Commercial Demand indicator which likes to stay above 50% for most of the game. The game automatically builds new commercial buildings if the demand is high thus leading very often to overinvesting in commercial zones.

I will add some more info, depending on the comments and questions. I will keep "TESTING" flag for some time and see if any problems would be reported.

Performance impact is actually positive. The formulas used here are faster than original ones.

[u]Compatibility[/u]
It changes the method that calculates commercial demand ofc. I am not aware of any popular mods that would be not compatible.

[u]Detailed description[/u]

Commercial Demand is basically a sum of two demands
a) demand for workers, and
b) demand for customers.

The demand for workers is based on a well known 8:1 ratio that links homes (yes homes, not citizens) with commercial workers. I.e. if there is 1 worker per 8 homes then the demand is 0. The mod doesn't change this.

The demand for customers (aka visitors) is based on what percentage of maximum number of customers there are (occupancy). The original formula is constructed in such a way that 66% occupancy gives 0, anything above 83% gives 50 and conversly anything below 50% gives -50. In a well managed city there is usually >90% of customers which means that commercial demand will always be at least 50.
The mod changes the formula in the following way. 50% occupancy gives 0, 100% gives 25 and 0% gives -25. This allows to have a residual commercial demand in the ranges of 10-20, depending on how well the workers are managed (see above).
